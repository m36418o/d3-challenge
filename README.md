# D3 Challenge
## About
In this module, we used the prior knowledge of graphs from plotly and apply it with pure d3.js and svg. THis allows better scaling of the graphics without any contouring or distortion of the pixels. This is aimed at expanding our knowledge of graphing with JavaScript while using different libraries and tools.
